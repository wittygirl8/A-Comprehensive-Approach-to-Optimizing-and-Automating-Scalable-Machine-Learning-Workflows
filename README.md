# Optimizing and Automating Scalable Machine Learning Workflows

## Project Overview
This project addresses the limitations of traditional CI/CD systems in handling machine learning (ML) workflows. By leveraging **AWS SageMaker** and **AWS Step Functions**, a robust and automated pipeline has been developed to optimize data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. This scalable solution enhances efficiency, reduces manual intervention, and ensures reliable performance in production ML environments.

## Key Features
- **Automated Data Preprocessing**: Uses SageMaker's `ScriptProcessor` for efficient, scalable data preprocessing, supporting large datasets stored in Amazon S3.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Implements AWS Step Functions to manage end-to-end workflows, including conditional branching and automated retries.
- **Distributed Model Training**: Leverages SageMaker for distributed training on scalable EC2 instances, such as `ml.m5.large`.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automates optimization using SageMakerâ€™s built-in hyperparameter tuning jobs, supporting algorithms like XGBoost.
- **Model Deployment**: Supports both batch and real-time inference endpoints with SageMaker.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Handles 10x data growth with reduced pipeline failure rates through dynamic resource allocation and error-handling mechanisms.

## Pipeline Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Input raw data from Amazon S3.
   - Perform cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering using SageMaker Processing jobs.
   - Store processed data back to S3.

2. **Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Define sequential and conditional tasks using AWS Step Functions.
   - Automate retries and transitions for tasks like training and evaluation.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train models using algorithms like XGBoost with distributed resources.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy models for real-time predictions using SageMaker endpoints.
   - Monitor deployed models using CloudWatch for performance tracking.
